# TODO

- Leverage types / component system for which entities are alive so we can query for them
  - A Hex should have components for if its alive and what its axial coord is so that
  we can fetch for it, seeing what alive siblings it has and such.
- Implement wraparound
- Implement Infinite world with some kind of on-screen off-screen thing
